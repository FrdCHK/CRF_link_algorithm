# CRF link algorithm
CRF link algorithm used for the bright Gaia-CRF validation with radio stars.
Sample data file (including both VLBI and Gaia) and source list are provided.
Run main.py to get an orientation+spin solution result, run orientation-only.py to get an orientation-only solution result.
## Environment:
* Python 3 (tested under 3.9)
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Astropy
